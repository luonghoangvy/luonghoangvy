# Hi there 👋 I'm Luong Hoang Vy (Vionna)

I’m passionate about building things that work — and that matter.  
Whether it’s developing prototypes with sensors and microcontrollers, designing user-friendly systems, or leading community STEM projects, I enjoy working at the intersection of **tech, users, and purpose**.

Currently focused on:
- Product development and MVP design
- Embedded systems (Arduino, Jetson Nano)
- Sustainable technology and community-driven innovation
- Exploring Product Owner tools & workflows
